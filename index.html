            <p>
                Don Norman is a pioneering cognitive scientist, author, and designer known as the "Father of User Experience (UX)," a term he helped popularize, championing human-centered design to create products and systems that are intuitive, effective, and enjoyable for people. <strong>This framework has 7 Stages: Goal, Intention, Action, Execution, Perceive, Interpret, Evaluate.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Gulf of Execution (Doing the action):</strong> The gap between what the user wants to do and what actions the system allows or makes visible.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Gulf of Evaluation (Understanding the result):</strong> The gap between what the system does and what the user can understand from its feedback.

            <h2>GOMs Model</h2>

            <p>
                GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection) is a cognitive model used in HCI to describe and predict how
                users perform tasks.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goals</strong> define what the user wants to achieve</li>
                <li><strong>Operators</strong> are basic physical or mental actions</li>
                <li><strong>Methods</strong> are alternative ways to achieve a goal</li>
                <li><strong>Selections</strong> determine which method a user chooses in a given context</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>KLM Model</h2>

            <p>
                The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) predicts how long expert users take to perform simple, short interaction
                tasks (typically under 20 seconds) by breaking them into low-level actions. It focuses only on the
                execution phase, assuming the user has already decided what to do. <br><br>
                KLM models tasks using basic operators such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, pointing, homing, drawing,
                mental preparation, and system response, each with an estimated time. By summing these times, KLM
                estimates total task duration. <br><br>
                Its main strength is comparing different systems or methods to see which is faster, making it a
                cost-effective tool for interface design and training, rather than a model of learning or complex
                problem solving.
